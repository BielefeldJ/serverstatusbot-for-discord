# serverstatusbot-for-discord


**ATTENTION: This bot uses the new rewriten version of [discord.py v1.0](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/rewrite)**

To install the rewrite version of discord.py, run:

    python3 -m pip install -U https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/archive/rewrite.zip#egg=discord.py[voice]

Using `pip3 install discord.py` will install the legacy version which won't work with this code repository.
